**[Title] VisionSpin: Efficient and Reliable Interaction Access Technology Based on Coordinated Head and Eye Movements**

**[Keywords]** Virtual Reality, Interaction Activation, Identity Authentication, Artificial Intelligence

**[Project Introduction]**
As virtual reality technology and embodied intelligence continue to develop and proliferate, humans increasingly need to interact collaboratively with individuals in the real world and intelligent agents in the virtual world. In this process, not only is the security of the interaction a concern, but there is also a high demand for the acceptability of the interaction process and whether it is smooth and natural. Due to the ubiquity of access devices and the dynamic nature of human-to-human and human-to-machine networks, efficient identity verification and interaction activation technologies are the first steps in achieving efficient collaborative interaction. How to achieve efficiency and reliability is an open challenge for academia and industry.

Facing this challenge, the project innovatively utilizes the human capability to control eye and head movements. By exploring the interaction space of combined head-eye movements, the project designs natural and efficient actions for identity authentication and interaction activation, aiming to solve the purpose of efficient and reliable entry into the virtual reality world and switching interaction targets.

Specifically, the innovations of this project include:

1. Innovatively using guided head-eye movements in specific patterns as personal identification features for identity authentication and voice assistant activation, providing new ideas and solutions for identity authentication in dynamic virtual-real interaction environments.
2. Through deep learning and machine learning techniques, the project efficiently and accurately extracts micro-movement features of the head and eyes, automating and intellectualizing the models for identity authentication and language activation. The recognition accuracy can exceed XX% and XX%.
3. It provides a secure, convenient, and user-friendly solution for identity authentication in dynamic virtual-real interaction environments. Compared to traditional methods of identity authentication, it significantly improves user experience and security. The project systematically and quantitatively verifies the accuracy, robustness, usability, and stability of the proposed identity authentication technology under different VR scenarios and conditions. Compared to traditional methods, it achieves optimization of over XX% and XX%.

In an era of rapid development of network technology and virtual reality, the future will definitely be a fusion of virtual and real. Against this backdrop of dynamic interaction, VisionSpin not only provides strong identity verification for the virtual-real interaction process but also offers valuable exploration and practice for the development of identity authentication technology in the future metaverse era. The research results of this project can be applied to various scenarios such as gaming, virtual socialization, and shopping in virtual-real combined settings. It also provides fundamental technological support for the application of virtual reality and augmented reality technologies in fields such as education, healthcare, industry, and security.
